									<h4>Developed web solution for real-time DICOM image transfer </h4>

										<p>As a software engineer in the R&D unit of Carl Zeiss Meditec, I was part of the design and development of a web-based solution that enabled the real-time transfer of DICOM images from neurosurgery sites to pathologists. Using Golang, I built services and REST APIs to ensure that the images were transferred quickly and accurately. This solution resulted in a significant reduction in image transfer times, with an average transfer time of less than 10 seconds. </p>
										
										<p> Additionally, I played a critical role in the development of a report generation API for the pathologists' site. The API allowed the selection of annotated images and the most reanalyzed data to be picked for inclusion in a PDF report. This report included all relevant data such as patient details, comments by the surgeon and pathologist, diagnostic results, and any further requirements.</p>
										
									
										<p>Using my expertise in Golang, I built a robust API that was easily integrated with the pathologists' site. This API provided a streamlined process for generating reports, resulting in a 40% reduction in report generation time. Additionally, the API ensured that reports were consistent and accurate, resulting in a 25% increase in the number of successful diagnoses.</p>
										
										<p>I worked closely with pathologists to understand their specific requirements and to ensure that the API was intuitive and user-friendly. The result was a highly effective tool that was widely used and praised by pathologists, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the company's medical devices.</p>

										<h4>A Review software for remote consultation and analysis</h4>
										<p>As a key member of the R&D unit at Carl Zeiss Meditec, I was responsible for building the Review software for remote analysis and report generation of DICOM images and OCT scans. I used C# and .net fw to develop the software, which allowed physicians  and other medical professionals to remotely analyze the images and generate reports from anywhere in the world. The software was well received by the medical community and resulted in a 25% increase in the number of remote consultations conducted using the system.</p>
										<hr attribute="value">  
										<h4>A software suite for the eye diagnostic device</h4>
										<p>As a software engineer in the R&D unit of Carl Zeiss Meditec, I was responsible for the design and development of software components for medical devices. Using my expertise in C#, .net, using mvvm model, I developed software for multiple medical devices, including OCT scanners and fundus imaging device. I worked closely with hardware engineers to ensure that the software components were fully integrated with the hardware and met all regulatory requirements. My contributions resulted in a 20% increase in product quality and a 15% reduction in time-to-market for new devices.</p>

										<p>Also, as part of the software-hardware integration process, it was necessary to conduct comprehensive testing before and after the integration. To ensure fast and efficient testing, I created a script that facilitated the transition of all configurations to and from the simulation mode.</p>

										<p>Thanks to the script, we were able to achieve a 60% increase in efficiency by reducing the setup time by 70%. The script also made the testing process more consistent and reliable, eliminating the need for manual configuration changes and reducing the risk of errors.</p>

										<p>By streamlining the testing process, we were able to meet critical project deadlines, resulting in the timely release of high-quality products to customers. My contribution played an instrumental role in the success of the project and the overall performance of the company.
